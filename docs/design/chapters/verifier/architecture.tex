\section{Verification Logic Architecture}

The verificaton part contains several components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proof Deserialization:} Handles the input data processing (marshalling/demarshalling) mechanisms.

    These mechanisms are defined within the \texttt{*\_marshalling}-postfixed files.

    \item \textbf{Proof Verification:} Includes a verification of the hash-based commitment scheme and the proof itself.

    The verification itself is defined within the directory \texttt{components}, each of which defines a set of gates
    relevant to particular component.

    \item \item \item \textbf{Circuits Definition:} Full proof verification requires for the proof circuits to be defined within
    with the EVM-interpretable bytecode.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{State Proof Sequence Maintenance}
\label{subsec:stateseq}

To verify the validator set within the state proof submitted is derived from 
original Solana's genesis data, it is supposed to maintain validator's set state
proofs sequence on in-EVM side in a data structure as follows.

Let $B_{n_1}$ be the last state confirmed on Ethereum. Let us say some prover 
wants to confirm a new $B_{n_2}$ state. Denote by $H_{B}$ the hash of a state $B$.
So a Merkle Tree $T_{n_1, n_2}$ from the set $\{H_{B_{n_1}}, ..., H_{B_{n_2}}\}$


The state proof sequence correctness statement contains (but not bounded by) the following points:
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Proving Statement}
    \label{circuit}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the validator set is correct.
        \item Show that the $B_{n_1}$ corresponds to the last confirmed state on Ethereum.
        \item for $i$ from the interval $[n_1 + 1, n_2 - 1]$:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Show that $B_{i}$ contains $H_{B_{i - 1}}$ as a hash of the previous state.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item for $i$ from the interval $[n_2, n_2 + 32]$:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Show that $B_{i}$ contains $H_{B_{i - 1}}$ as a hash of the previous state.
            \item Show that there are enough valid signatures from the current validator set for $B_{i}$.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Build a Merkle Tree $T_{n_1, n_2}$ from the set $\{H_{B_{n_1}}, ..., H_{B_{n_2}}\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

$T_{n_1, n_2}$ allows to provide a successful transaction from $\{B_{n_1}, ..., B_{n_2}\}$ to the Ethereum-based proof verificator later.
